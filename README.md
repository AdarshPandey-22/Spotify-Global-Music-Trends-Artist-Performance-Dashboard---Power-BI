## 📖 Project Overview
This project involves a deep dive into **Spotify's Global Music Trends**, analyzing streaming data to uncover what makes a song a hit. The interactive **Power BI Dashboard** visualizes key metrics such as stream counts, artist popularity, and audio features (danceability, energy, bpm) to identify patterns in successful music.

The dashboard serves as a tool for record labels, artists, and analysts to understand listener behavior and global performance metrics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To analyze global streaming data and answer critical questions about the music industry:
* Which artists and songs are dominating the global charts?
* How do audio features (e.g., higher BPM or "Danceability") correlate with total streams?
* What are the seasonal trends in music streaming?
* Which genres have the highest listener engagement?

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Total Streams:** [e.g., 50 Billion+]
* **Total Tracks Analyzed:** [e.g., 2,500]
* **Unique Artists:** [e.g., 850]
* **Average Popularity Score:** [e.g., 72/100]

## 📈 Visualizations & Features
* **Global Stream Distribution:** A map visualization showing the density of streams across different regions.
* **Top 10 Artists by Streams:** A bar chart ranking the most successful artists (e.g., The Weeknd, Taylor Swift).
* **Audio Features Analysis:** A scatter plot or radar chart comparing "Energy" vs. "Danceability" to see what kind of vibe is trending.
* **Yearly Trends:** A line graph tracking the growth of streaming numbers over the last 5 years.
* **Song Duration vs. Popularity:** An analysis to determine if shorter or longer songs perform better.
* **Interactive Slicers:** Filters for *Year*, *Genre*, and *Artist* to allow users to explore specific segments of the data.

## 🔍 Key Insights
* **Top Artist:** [e.g., The Weeknd] holds the record for the most cumulative streams in the dataset.
* **Viral Traits:** Songs with high "Danceability" scores (above [e.g., 0.7]) tend to have [e.g., 20%] more streams on average.
* **Release Timing:** The majority of hit songs are released in [e.g., May and June], coinciding with summer trends.
* **Platform Dominance:** A strong correlation was found between Spotify playlists inclusion and total streams.

## 🧰 Tools Used
* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization.
* **Microsoft Excel / CSV:** For raw data storage and initial preprocessing.
